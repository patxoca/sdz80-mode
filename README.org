=sdz80-mode= is an emacs major mode that provides some helpers for
programming assembler code for the =sdas= assembler bundled with sdcc.

* Features

=sdz80-mode= inherits from =asm-mode= adding the following features:

- /imenu/ integration allows to quickly jump to any label in the file.

- highlight Z80 registers.

- implements an /electric colon/ supporting the =sdasm= double colon
  syntax for global labels.

- automatically add =.globl= directive for the symbol at point.

- updates the header file (=.h.s=) with all global labels defined in
  the source code.

* Keybindings

- =:=: electric colon

- =C-c m g=: declare global symbol at point

- =C-c m h=: update header file
